A demo/exploration in hooking together Jekyll, Webpack, React, and an admin/editing GUI for use in other projects.

Draws from https://github.com/allizad/jekyll-webpack for hooking together Jekyll, Webpack, and React.

Uses [Concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently) to run `webpack` and `jekyll serve` at the same time.

Uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for testing with [snapshot testing](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/tutorial-react.html#content) for React components.
